## author identification

for react application, there are two authors, Jay and Alex(yu), you may see a root editor, that is also done by Alex.

## Project description

This is a React-application for our assignment 2 front-end. 
The highest level component is called "StartPage". And you may find five navigation buttons directing to 5 subcomponents of "RequestList", "LeaderBoard", "MyPosts", "Transaction", "Party".
In the main components we implement many modals to display or hide components of "LoginPage", "LogoutPage", "SignupPage", "AddRequest", "AddRewards", "CompletePost".	In the main components we implement many modals to display or hide components of "LoginPage", "LogoutPage", "SignupPage", "AddRequest", "AddRewards", "CompletePost", "Add Transaction".
Globally we store the userID into React-cookies when user log in.
We have used some simple modules from "Ant Design" which is an open source repository for react apps.

## Third Party Software
In this application we are using Third party software Firebase to upload image and store its replica url in our database. 

## How to run this react-app
If you want to run this react-app in development mode, please go into directory '/client' and (use 'npm install' to install outsourced packages) then use command 'npm start'.
Then Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
